    <code>My Personal AI Usage Philosophy</code>
  </summary>

  > Over the past few years I've sought guidance and read countless opinions regarding AI use in learning, and it's difficult to find widespread consensus. For that reason, I wanted to clearly state my own view (as of January 2026) since it can be very difficult to really figure out what kind of developer someone really is.
  > 
  > Currently, the main AI tool I use is ChatGPT. In the past, I have used AI image generators in order to avoid trademark/copyright concerns for my little personal projects, but my goal moving forward is to use these very minimally. I also currently avoid tools that autocomplete code as you type, as it personally feels counter-productive to the learning process--but, I do realize and understand that it may be necessary to use tools like this for some jobs where speed or output is more important than individual deep understanding.
  > 
  > As far as ChatGPT, I mostly use it as a personal tutor/mentor, especially while learning skills that are new to me, such as full-stack web development concepts or unfamiliar programming languages. My goal, generally speaking, is to get exposure to concepts that are outside of my comfort zone as a student and developer, and then to get to a point where I can create more advanced programs without needing AI at all, in the same way that you might learn how to code from a textbook or video tutorial. Furthermore, I strive to understand these concepts enough to be able to identify where the AI suggestions are not actually ideal, or where issues may arise from the generated code. Throughout this process, though, I still do manually type out all code that I commit, and I ensure that I understand how the code works, the reasoning behind it, and so on, before ever pushing changes. I also try to get input on how to develop my projects in a way that is as close to industry best practices as possible, so that I'm preparing myself as much as I can for professional programming beyond my simple solo hobby projects.
  > 
  > Above all, my goal with this explanation is to hopefully convey that I am striving to become a software developer who is great even without AI, but one who still makes reasonable use of AI to be a more efficient and faster learner. I'm constantly trying to find that balance of using these powerful tools without overly relying on them and causing my own skills to degrade as a result, and I'm always open to new views and better approaches.
